"""Shelf Life job — score every owned title for how much it has earned its
space, and flag the ones below the line for a space cleanup.

The scoring itself is core/video/shelf_life.py (pure); this job gathers each
title's facts from the library, scores movies and shows, stores every result
(the library and detail pages read the store, they never score), and creates a
finding for each candidate. Watched Cleanup is left alone: a movie it already
has a pending finding for is scored but not flagged twice.

Watching counts people (#1941): the owner (the shared columns) and every
profile linked to its own Plex account, each by its own watch state. How many
of them watched anything in the last ``active_days`` only decides whether
watching can tell at all; with no linked profiles the owner is the only
person, and always counts.

Approving a finding deletes the WHOLE title through Delete Title
(core/video/delete_title.py): acquisition stopped for every profile, the folder
to the recycle bin, the title hidden from Discover. Like Delete Title it only
runs with the title typed exactly; the typed title arrives as the fix_action,
so a blanket "fix all" can never delete anything. Dismissed titles are never
flagged again.
